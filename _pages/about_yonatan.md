I'm **Yonatan G. Achamyeleh**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). My research focuses on enhancing the security of embedded and cyber-physical systems through machine learning techniques applied to binary analysis and instrumentation.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from UCI and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST. During the summers, I interned at Intel Corporation (2X), working on computer systems security and architecture, and Siemens, working on Machine Learning based patch generation for securing legacy binaries.

Feel free to check out my [publications](/publications/) or connect with me through my [X](https://x.com/YonatanGizachew) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_5z8U80AAAAJ) profiles. I'm open to collaborations on projects related to security, machine learning, and embedded systems. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in working together.
