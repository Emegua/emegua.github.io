abstract = {Mission-critical embedded software is critical to our society's infrastructure but can be subject to new security vulnerabilities as technology advances. When security issues arise, Reverse Engineers (REs) use Software Reverse Engineering (SRE) tools to analyze vulnerable binaries. However, existing tools have limited support, and REs undergo a time-consuming, costly, and error-prone process that requires experience and expertise to understand the behaviors of software and vulnerabilities. To improve these tools, we propose cfg2vec, a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach. To represent binary, we propose a novel Graph-of-Graph (GoG) representation, combining the information of control-flow and function-call graphs. Our cfg2vec learns how to represent each binary function compiled from various CPU architectures, utilizing hierarchical GNN and the siamese network-based supervised learning architecture. We evaluate cfg2vec's capability of predicting function names from stripped binaries. Our results show that cfg2vec outperforms the state-of-the-art by 24.54\% in predicting function names and can even achieve 51.84\% better given more training data. Additionally, cfg2vec consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art for all CPU architectures, while the baseline requires multiple training to achieve similar performance. More importantly, our results demonstrate that our cfg2vec could tackle binaries built from unseen CPU architectures, thus indicating that our approach can generalize the learned knowledge. Lastly, we demonstrate its practicability by implementing it as a Ghidra plugin used during resolving DARPA Assured MicroPatching (AMP) challenges.},

abstract = {A Negative Pressure Room (NPR) is an essential requirement by the Bio-Safety Levels (BSLs) in biolabs or infectious-control hospitals to prevent deadly pathogens from being leaked from the facility. An NPR maintains a negative pressure inside with respect to the outside reference space so that microbes are contained inside of an NPR. Nowadays, differential pressure sensors (DPSs) are utilized by the Building Management Systems (BMSs) to control and monitor the negative pressure in an NPR. This paper demonstrates a non-invasive and stealthy attack on NPRs by spoofing a DPS at its resonant frequency. Our contributions are: (1) We show that DPSs used in NPRs typically have resonant frequencies in the audible range. (2) We use this finding to design malicious music to create resonance in DPSs, resulting in an overshooting in the DPS's normal pressure readings. (3) We show how the resonance in DPSs can fool the BMSs so that the NPR turns its negative pressure to a positive one, causing a potential leak of deadly microbes from NPRs. We do experiments on 8 DPSs from 5 different manufacturers to evaluate their resonant frequencies considering the sampling tube length and find resonance in 6 DPSs. We can achieve a 2.5 Pa change in negative pressure from a ~7 cm distance when a sampling tube is not present and from a ~2.5 cm distance for a 1 m sampling tube length. We also introduce an interval-time variation approach for an adversarial control over the negative pressure and show that the forged pressure can be varied within 12 - 33 Pa. Our attack is also capable of attacking multiple NPRs simultaneously. Moreover, we demonstrate our attack at a real-world NPR located in an anonymous bioresearch facility, which is FDA approved and follows CDC guidelines. We also provide countermeasures to prevent the attack.},

  abstract={Network-based security has emerged as an increasingly critical challenge in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT). A number of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), typically relying on sophisticated machine learning (ML) algorithms, have been proposed to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity. However, these NIDS designs require extensive memory and computational power, exceeding the capability of today’s IoT devices, and often fail to provide timely detection of network attacks. To tackle this issue, we propose HyperDetect , the first attempt at NIDS modeling that leverages the highly efficient and parallel operations of brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC). Our innovative model updating method effectively mitigates model saturation and significantly reduces the number of retraining iterations needed to reach convergence. Additionally, we employ a novel dynamic encoding technique to regenerate insignificant dimensions, considerably lowering the dimensionalities required to achieve high-quality performance and further accelerating the learning process. HyperDetect delivers on average 5.02× faster training and 31.83× faster inference compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning approaches on a wide range of network intrusion classification tasks. We also extensively evaluate HyperDetect on embedded hardware to demonstrate its low-latency and resource-efficient characteristics.},

  abstract={Differential Pressure Sensors are widely deployed to monitor critical environments. However, our research unveils a previously overlooked vulnerability: their high sensitivity to pressure variations makes them susceptible to acoustic side-channel attacks. We demonstrate that the pressure-sensing diaphragms in DPS can inadvertently capture subtle air vibrations caused by speech, which propagate through the sensor's components and affect the pressure readings. Exploiting this discovery, we introduce BaroVox, a novel attack that reconstructs speech from DPS readings, effectively turning DPS into a "fly on the wall." We model the effect of sound on DPS, exploring the limits and challenges of acoustic leakage. To overcome these challenges, we propose two solutions: a signal-processing approach using a unique spectral subtraction method and a deep learning-based approach for keyword classification. Evaluations under various conditions demonstrate BaroVox's effectiveness, achieving a word error rate of 0.29 for manual recognition and 90.51% accuracy for automatic recognition. Our findings highlight the significant privacy implications of this vulnerability. We also discuss potential defense strategies to mitigate the risks posed by BaroVox.},
