I'm **Yonatan G. Achamyeleh**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). My research focuses on enhancing the security of embedded and cyber-physical systems through machine learning techniques applied to binary analysis and instrumentation.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from UCI and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST. During the summers, I interned at Intel Corporation (2X), working on computer systems security and architecture, and Siemens, working on Machine Learning based patch generation for securing legacy binaries.

Feel free to check out my [publications](/publications/) or connect with me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/emegua) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_5z8U80AAAAJ) profiles. I'm open to collaborations on projects related to security, machine learning, and embedded systems. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in working together.

### <span style="color:Maroon;">Research Interests</span>

#### Binary Code Analysis for Security

- **Cross-Architecture Binary Analysis Using GNNs and Transformers:**  
  Researching techniques that integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with transformer models to analyze and interpret binary code across diverse CPU architectures. This approach enables effective function name prediction and vulnerability detection in stripped binaries, supporting robust cross-platform reverse engineering essential for secure software maintenance.

- **Hierarchical Graph Representations for Code Analysis:**  
  Utilizing hierarchical graph structures to represent relationships within binaries, such as control-flow and function-call dependencies. These representations, processed by GNNs, facilitate complex security analyses that enhance resilience against binary-level vulnerabilities and inform the patching of legacy and embedded systems.

- **Memory Safety and Compiler-Based Security for Legacy Software:**  
  Focusing on compiler-driven techniques to retrofit memory safety into legacy binaries without source code access. This includes using post-link binary optimization within compiler frameworks to detect and mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities, enhancing the resilience of embedded and legacy systems used in critical applications.

#### Cyber-Physical Systems Security

- **Side-Channel Vulnerabilities and Signal-Based Attacks:**  
  Investigating side-channel vulnerabilities in cyber-physical systems, particularly those exploiting acoustic and pressure-based signals. This research focuses on using advanced deep learning techniques to extract sensitive information from unintended signal leakage, addressing privacy risks in sectors like industrial automation and healthcare.

- **Industrial Control System Security and Provenance Tracking:**  
  Applying machine learning models, including transformers, to monitor and verify the integrity of industrial control systems (ICS) and other critical infrastructure components. This work strengthens system security in automation and industrial environments by tracking toolchain provenance and analyzing behavioral patterns in programmable logic controllers (PLCs).

### <span style="color:Maroon;">Selected Projects</span>

- **AGNOMIN:**  
  An architecture-agnostic framework leveraging hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for multi-label function name prediction.

- **CFG2VEC:**  
  Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Cross-Architectural Software Reverse Engineering.

- **HyperDetect:**  
  A hyperdimensional computing solution designed for real-time intrusion detection in IoT networks.

- **BaroVox:**  
  An acoustic side-channel framework enabling speech reconstruction from differential pressure sensors.
